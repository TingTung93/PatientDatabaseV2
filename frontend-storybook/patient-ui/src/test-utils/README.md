# Testing Strategy

## Overview

Our testing strategy combines Storybook for component development and testing with Jest for unit tests. This approach provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining developer efficiency.

## Tools & Framework

1. **Storybook**
   - Component development and documentation
   - Visual testing
   - Interaction testing
   - Accessibility testing
   - Viewport testing

2. **Jest + Testing Library**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - API mocking

3. **Playwright**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Cross-browser testing

## Test Types

### 1. Component Tests (Storybook)
- Located alongside components with `.stories.tsx` extension
- Test component rendering and interactions
- Include different states and variations
- Automated accessibility checks
- Visual regression testing across viewports

### 2. Unit Tests
- Located in `__tests__` directories
- Test business logic and utilities
- Focus on pure functions and hooks
- High coverage for core functionality

### 3. Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- API integration testing
- Form submissions and validations
- State management testing

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Critical user flows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Component Testing**
   - Create stories for all significant states
   - Include interaction tests using play functions
   - Document component usage in stories
   - Test accessibility for all components

2. **Test Organization**
   - Keep tests close to implementation
   - Use meaningful test descriptions
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Avoid test interdependence

3. **Test Data**
   - Use factories for test data
   - Avoid sharing mutable state
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use realistic test data

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run Storybook tests
npm run test-storybook

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull request creation
- Push to main branch
- Release creation

## Test Coverage

We aim for:
- 100% coverage of core business logic
- 80% coverage of UI components
- Critical user flows covered by E2E tests
