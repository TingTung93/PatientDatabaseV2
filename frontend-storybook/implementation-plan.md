# React Storybook UI/UX Implementation Plan for Patient Database V2

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a React-based Storybook UI/UX that will interact with all endpoints from the existing Patient Database V2 backend. The UI will provide a comprehensive interface for managing patient records, processing OCR documents, and handling real-time updates via WebSocket connections.

## API Integration

### REST API Integration

#### Patient Endpoints
- Implement API clients for patient CRUD operations
- Create custom hooks for accessing patient data
- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting
- Add type definitions for patient data

#### Report Endpoints
- Implement API clients for report CRUD operations
- Create file upload handling for report attachments
- Implement custom hooks for reports data
- Add type definitions for report data

#### Caution Card Endpoints
- Implement API clients for caution card operations
- Create image upload handling for caution cards
- Implement custom hooks for caution card data
- Add type definitions for caution card data

#### OCR Processing Endpoints
- Implement API clients for OCR operations
- Create file upload handling for OCR documents
- Implement status polling for OCR jobs
- Add type definitions for OCR data

### WebSocket Integration
- Implement EventClient wrapper around Socket.IO
- Set up event listeners for all WebSocket events
- Create reconciliation mechanism for missed events
- Implement real-time UI updates based on WebSocket events

## Storybook Implementation

### Story Organization
- Group stories by functional area (Patients, Caution Cards, OCR)
- Create multiple story variations for each component
- Implement Storybook controls to demonstrate component variants
- Provide documentation for each component

### Mock Data
- Create mock data fixtures for all entity types
- Implement mock API handlers using MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Create mock WebSocket events for real-time scenarios

### Accessibility
- Implement accessibility checks in Storybook
- Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Document accessibility considerations for each component

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up React project with TypeScript
- Configure Storybook
- Implement common UI components
- Create basic API clients and WebSocket integration

### Phase 2: Patient Management
- Implement patient list and detail views
- Create patient forms with validation
- Implement advanced search functionality
- Add Storybook stories for all patient components

### Phase 3: Caution Cards
- Create caution card components
- Implement caution card list and detail views
- Add Storybook stories for caution card components

### Phase 4: OCR Integration
- Implement OCR upload functionality
- Create OCR progress and result components
- Integrate with WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add Storybook stories for all OCR components

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- Create comprehensive component tests
- Add integration tests for complex interactions
- Complete Storybook documentation
- Create user documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for all components using React Testing Library and Jest
- Test interaction patterns and accessibility
- Verify component props and state management

### API Integration Testing
- Test API client functionality
- Mock API responses for testing
- Verify error handling

### WebSocket Testing
- Test WebSocket event handling
- Verify UI updates on WebSocket events
- Test reconnection and event reconciliation

## Conclusion

This implementation plan outlines a comprehensive approach to building a React-based Storybook UI/UX that integrates with all endpoints of the Patient Database V2 backend. The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, focusing on building reusable components that can be thoroughly documented and tested in Storybook.
