# Security Improvements Documentation

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the Patient Information Application.

## 1. Environment Variables

All sensitive configuration has been moved from hardcoded values to environment variables:

- **Database credentials**: All database connection parameters (host, port, username, password) now use environment variables
- **JWT secrets**: JWT signing keys are now loaded from environment variables with no default fallbacks
- **Application secrets**: Flask SECRET_KEY and other sensitive values are now environment-based

An `.env.example` file has been created in the root directory to guide developers in setting up required environment variables.

## 2. Password Security

Password handling has been standardized across the application:

- **Consistent hashing**: All password hashing now uses bcrypt with a consistent work factor (12 rounds)
- **Proper salt generation**: Random salts are generated for each password
- **Password strength validation**: Passwords must meet minimum requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- **Secure storage**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext and are excluded from default queries
- **Timing attack prevention**: Constant-time comparison for authentication operations

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Comprehensive input validation and sanitization has been implemented across all routes:

- **Parameter validation**: All parameters (path, query, body) are validated before use
- **Type checking**: Data types are validated to prevent injection and type confusion attacks
- **Format validation**: Formats for dates, IDs, and other fields are validated
- **Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized before storage or display to prevent XSS

## 4. Protection Against Web Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection Protection
- All database queries use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- Database access is performed through abstraction layers with built-in security
- Input validation prevents malicious inputs from reaching database layer

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection
- All output is sanitized with appropriate encoding for context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.)
- Content Security Policy headers recommended to prevent malicious script execution
- Input sanitization removes dangerous markup and scripts

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- CSRF token requirement for all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Token validation on server side for each non-GET request
- Tokens are tied to user sessions for additional security

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT tokens include appropriate claims (issuer, audience, expiration)
- JWT token validation with proper error handling
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Authorization checks on all protected endpoints

### Additional Security Measures
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Secure HTTP headers (recommendations added)
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## 5. Implementation Details

### JavaScript (Express) Backend
- `express-validator` for input validation
- `xss` library for sanitization
- `bcrypt` for password hashing
- Parameterized queries for SQL operations

### Python (Flask) Backend
- Input validation with custom validators
- `bleach` for input sanitization
- `bcrypt` for consistent password hashing
- SQLAlchemy parameterized queries

## 6. Recommendations for Deployment

- Set up HTTPS with proper certificates
- Configure secure HTTP headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
- Implement rate limiting at application or infrastructure level
- Use secrets management services instead of .env files in production
- Implement regular security scanning and updates
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
