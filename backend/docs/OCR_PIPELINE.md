# OCR Processing Pipeline

## Overview

The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline processes patient documents through several stages to extract accurate information. This system is designed for reliability, security, and accuracy with a focus on medical document processing.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Secure File Upload

- **Validation**: Uploaded files undergo strict validation:
  - File type verification using MIME type and magic bytes
  - Size limits (20MB maximum)
  - Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal and XSS
  - Virus scanning

- **Security Measures**:
  - Files are quarantined if suspicious
  - Checksums are generated for file integrity
  - Files are stored in access-controlled temporary directories
  - Secure deletion when processing is complete

### 2. Image Preprocessing

Images undergo several preprocessing steps to optimize for OCR accuracy:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Reduces complexity and improves text detection
- **Contrast Normalization**: Enhances distinction between text and background
- **Noise Reduction**: Subtle Gaussian blur (0.5) to reduce noise without losing detail
- **Thresholding**: Converts image to binary (black and white) for clearer text detection
- **Resize**: Standardizes dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio (max 2000Ã—2000px)

### 3. OCR Text Extraction

- The preprocessed image is passed to Tesseract.js OCR engine
- Python bridge enables advanced OCR capabilities
- Full-text recognition is performed with optimization for medical documents
- Raw text output is captured with confidence scores

### 4. Data Extraction

- Key fields are extracted from the OCR text:
  - Patient name
  - Date of birth
  - Medical record number
  - Blood type
  - Other medical information based on document type
- Pattern matching and NLP techniques identify structured information
- Confidence scores are assigned to each extracted field

### 5. Data Validation

Extracted data undergoes validation to ensure accuracy:

- **Field Validation**: Each field is validated for format and expected values
  - Names: Minimum length, allowed characters
  - Dates: Format standardization to ISO (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Blood Types: Normalization to standard format (A+, B-, etc.)
  - Medical IDs: Format and checksum validation where applicable

- **Confidence Thresholds**: Fields with low confidence are flagged for manual review
- **Error Detection**: Pattern recognition to identify common OCR errors

### 6. Data Storage and Update

- Validated data is stored in the database
- Real-time updates are propagated to connected clients via WebSockets
- Audit logging captures all data modifications
- Original documents are securely stored with access controls

## Error Handling & Recovery

- **Preprocessing Fallbacks**: If preprocessing fails, the original image is used
- **Missing Data Detection**: System identifies and flags missing required fields
- **Manual Correction Interface**: UI for reviewing and correcting low-confidence extractions
- **Training Data Collection**: User corrections are collected to improve future OCR accuracy

## Security Considerations

- **PHI Protection**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for document access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all document access and modifications
- **Secure File Handling**: Documents are processed in memory where possible and securely deleted when no longer needed

## Monitoring and Performance

- **Processing Metrics**: Time spent in each pipeline stage is tracked
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Confidence scores and correction rates are monitored
- **System Health**: Resource usage during OCR processing is monitored
- **Batch Processing**: Large document sets can be queued for efficient processing

## Training and Improvement

The system includes a feedback loop for continuous improvement:

1. User corrections are stored as training data
2. Periodic model retraining incorporates these corrections
3. Common error patterns are identified and addressed
4. Preprocessing parameters are adjusted based on performance metrics

## Integration Points

- **Frontend**: WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for document upload and data retrieval
- **Database**: Structured storage of extracted information
- **Logging**: Winston integration for comprehensive logging
