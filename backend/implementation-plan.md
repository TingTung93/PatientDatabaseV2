# Implementation Plan

## Completed Implementations

### 1. File Upload Security Enhancements [SFT]

- **SecureFileHandler Improvements**:
  - Added file type detection using file signatures (magic bytes)
  - Added comprehensive filename sanitization to prevent path traversal and XSS
  - Implemented secure file deletion with data overwrite
  - Added quarantine mechanism for suspicious files
  - Implemented checksum verification for file integrity

- **FileValidation Middleware Enhancements**:
  - Integrated with SecureFileHandler for improved security
  - Added comprehensive validation pipeline for uploaded files
  - Implemented file content verification against declared MIME type
  - Added temporary file tracking and secure cleanup
  - Improved error handling and logging

### 2. OCR Processing Pipeline [ISA]

- **Image Preprocessing**:
  - Added grayscale conversion to improve text recognition
  - Implemented contrast normalization for better readability
  - Added noise reduction with controlled Gaussian blur
  - Implemented thresholding for clearer text separation
  - Added image resizing with aspect ratio preservation

- **Data Validation**:
  - Added field validation for extracted patient data
  - Implemented format standardization (dates, blood types)
  - Added confidence scoring for extracted fields
  - Implemented error detection and reporting

### 3. Documentation

- Added comprehensive OCR pipeline documentation
- Documented file validation security mechanisms
- Added test implementations for security and validation features

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Data Validation Layer

- Extend BaseValidator with additional validation methods
- Implement more specific validators for each data type
- Add cross-field validation rules

### 2. Enhance XSS Protection

- Add HTML sanitization for text inputs
- Implement content security policy headers
- Add frame protection headers

### 3. Complete OCR Pipeline Testing

- Implement integration tests for full OCR workflow
- Add performance tests for OCR processing
- Create test fixtures for different document types

### 4. Real-time Features

- Complete WebSocket integration for OCR progress updates
- Implement event system for updates
- Add connection management and error recovery
