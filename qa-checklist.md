## 2. Medium Priority Tasks

### State Management Optimization
- [ ] WebSocket Management
  - [x] Create WebSocket context/hook using `websocketService.ts` (*Refactoring task*)
  - [x] Implement reconnection strategy (`websocketService.ts` has it, verify)
  - [x] Add event buffering/queueing (`websocketService.ts` has it, verify)
  - [x] Improve error handling (`websocketService.ts` has it, verify)
- [ ] React Query Optimization
  - [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation (Review existing invalidations)
  - [ ] Add retry logic (React Query default or custom)
  - [ ] Add request deduplication (React Query default)
  - [ ] Optimize prefetching (Identify key areas)

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Component Optimization
  - [x] Implement proper memoization (Review key components)
  - [ ] Add code splitting (e.g., per page/feature)
  - [ ] Optimize bundle size (Analyze build output)
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring (e.g., React DevTools Profiler, Web Vitals)
- [ ] API Optimization
  - [ ] Implement request caching (React Query handles this, review configurations)
  - [ ] Add request batching (If applicable for backend)
  - [ ] Optimize data fetching (Ensure only necessary data is fetched)
  - [ ] Add request queuing (If needed for specific scenarios)

### Documentation
- [ ] Component Documentation
